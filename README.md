## 📌 Project Overview

Diabetes is a chronic disease that requires early identification for effective management. This project applies data analysis and machine learning techniques to identify patterns in health indicators and predict whether an individual is diabetic.

The workflow includes:
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training and evaluation
- Interpretation of results

## 🧠 Methodology

1. Data loading and preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis to understand feature distributions and class balance  
3. Training classification models (e.g., Random Forest, KNN)  
4. Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  

---

## 📈 Results Summary

The models were evaluated using standard classification metrics. The results show strong performance in predicting non-diabetic cases, with room for improvement in identifying diabetic cases, likely due to class imbalance.

These findings highlight the importance of further tuning and balancing techniques to improve predictive performance.
